\section{Related Work}

One of the previous cross layer study combined inferred RRC state information with collected device power trace to imply application behaviors leading to unnecessary energy consumption~\cite{aro}. Their primarily focus on the application level energy optimization instead of latency. The QxDM in our study provides more fine grained performance, latency and power information. We could have more detailed insights to understand data link layer root cause for abnormal latency and inefficient energy consumption behaviors in upper layer. 

Related to our RLC fast retransmission proposal, a previous study provides cross comparison analysis over the TCP and RLC protocols, and optimizes the default protocol parameters~\cite{opt.tcp.rlc}. Their primary goal is to improve the performance behavior by introducing TCP congestion control mechanism into the RLC layer. However, their traces are purely generated from simulation software, whereas we use real traffic traces.
